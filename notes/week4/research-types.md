# Research Types (2/6/24)

Framed by a hypothesis, Methodology to test the hypothesis, Experiments, Hypothesis must be narrow and clear to allow for verificatino or disproval

### Theoretical Research

### Empirical Research

Capable of being proved or disproved by observation or experiment

#### Observational

Interviews, in the wild studies, case studies, etc. Focusing on qualitative assessments (opposite of numerical data)

Relevance vs Precision:
- High in relevance (can reach a large amount of people)
- Low in precision (We cannot control the environment)

#### Experiemental

Controlled experiement. Focuses on quantitative data and assessments

Relevance vs Precision:
  - Low in relevance (artificial environment and because we are only using a subset of people)
  - High in precision (extraneous variables are easy to control)
  - Independent (Manipulated) Variable, and Dependent (Response) Variable

The goal of this is to observe cause and effect situations and make conclusions based on the data

#### Correlational

Looking for relationships between variables. Observations made, data collected and examined. Balance between relevance and precision

#### Methods
```
    / Observational (high relevance low precision)
HCI - Correlational (average relevance average precision)
    \ Experiemental (low relevance high precision)
```

#### Observe and Measure

Oberservations are made by ... the aparatus or by a human observer

Manuel Observation are made by ... log sheets, notebooks, screen capture, photographs, videos, etc.

##### Measurement Scales
1. Ratio (A "count" is a ratio-scale measurement | ex. a 10-word phrase entered in 30sec -> 20wpm)
2. Interval (equal distances between ajacent values | ex Farunheight and Celcius)
   - The statistical mean is possible now however ratios are not
3. Ordinal (associate an order or rank to an attirubte | ex. user tries GPS systems for a time and then ranks the software 1st 2nd and 3rd)
   - More sophisticated since greater than or less than comparisions are possible
4. Nominal (catagorical data | ex. gender, job title, licence plate #)
   - Does not have to be a number (M = male, F = female)

### Research Questions

We conduct research to answer and raise questions
  
A testable question is one that answers thr question

Example: 
- (BAD) Is the new technique any good?
- (WEAK) Is the new technique better than QSK?
- (BETTER) Is the new techqnique faster than QSK?
- (BETTER STILL) Is the measured entry speed (in words per minute) higher for the new technique than for QSK after one hour of use?

External Validity ~ when the results of a study can be generalized to other people and situations

There is always a tradeoff between Internal Validitiy & External Validity. Comparitive evaluations when doing a user study it is imperitive that you have something to compare your results to in order to give your results validity.

Correlational Relationships -> Circumstantial Relationships

Experimental Relationships -> Casual Relationships

It IS NOT POSSIBLE to avoid all confounding variables

When looking for papers...
- Think small
- Replicate the material
- know the literature
- think inside the box (assume nothing and challange everything)

### Signal and Noise Metaphor
```
        / Signal
  Source
        \ Noise
```

  Methodology ~ is the way the experiement will be carried out

  To submit your research to be published you need a HCI:ERP2e which can take up to a month
  Criteria:
    - research methodology
    - risk/benifits...

Charachteriestics such as (age, genderm weight, grip strength, etc) are all independent variables but they cannot be manipulated like traditional independent variables

Control Variable ~ is a circumstance not under investigation that is kept constant while testing the effect of an independant variable

Random Variable ~ is a variable that you cannot control (you give a participant an expresso before the experiment but that participant could have had more before they even started the experiement that is a random variable)

### Procedure
  1. Arrive and Welcome
  2. Consent Form
  3. Instructions given to participants about the experiemnt
  4. Demonstration Trial, practice trials
  5. Rest Break
  6. Administering questionaire or internview
