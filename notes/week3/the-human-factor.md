# Chapter 2: The Human Factor (1/30/24)

## Models of the Human

- It would be very useful to be able to describe human behavior based upon a defined model

- Newells Time Scale of Human Action (Time Scale for Human Systems to React to a Task)
    - Biological Band: neurons firing, body reactions (100 mcroseconds)
    - Cognitive Band: deliberate acts, operations (10s)
    - Rational Band: tasks (10min)
    - Social Band: tasks (months, days, years)
- Human Factors Model
  - Human <-> Interface <-> Computer
    - Brain <- Sensors <- Displays <- Machine State
    - Brain -> Respondors -> Controls -> Machine State

## Human Senses

### Vision (The eye)

- people get 80% of their information from their eyes
- Fixation ~ Eyes are stationary at least 200ms
- Saccade ~ Rapid repositioning of the eye to fixate on a new location at least 30-120ms

### Hearing (audition)

- Physical Properties of Sound
  - Frequency
  - Intensity
- Subjective Properties of Sound (based on subject's own perception)
  - Pitch
  - Loudness

- Timbre ~ Richness or Brightness of sound
- Attack ~ envelope and it comes form the way a note and its harmonics build up and transition in time

### Touch (tactition)

- Receptors in the skin muscles ad joint that provides feedback to the user
- Some examples include, pressing a key, clicking the mouse, your phone ringing. 

### Smell (olfaction)

- Ability to percieve odours
- Occurs though sensory cells in the nasal cavity

### Taste (gustation)

- Flavor a perceptual process that combines smell and taste
- Chemical reception of sweet, salty, bitter, and sour senesations

## All humans run into different things when designing systems

### Abiguity

- Muller-Lyer Arros
- Ponzo Lines
- Moon when it looks big outside but its just a fram of reference

### Illusion

- Munker Illusion (the two circles are the same color)
