# Historical Context of Human-Computer Interaction (1/23/24)
## Timeline of Significant Events

1945 ~ "As We May Think" was published

    - To addres information overload Bush in As we may think proposed memex -> which is a detailed concept that featured associative indexing, whereby points of interest that are connected and joined (hypertext, world wide web)

1962 ~ Sketchpad developed

    - Was part of MIT research made bu Ivan Sutherland
    - interactive graphics
    - light-pen
    - visibility of objects
    - exploration
    - direct manipulation
    - replacement language with action

1963 ~ computer mouse is invented

    - Made by Doug Engelbart
    - above all other devices in terms of HCI so far
    - Allows select-operations by moving your arm rather than light-pen
    - there wasnt a commercial mouse until 1981
    - lead to the first ever HCI study comparing the mouse to several other input options
      - 13 participants
      - independent variable: type of interaction
      - dependent variabe: task completion, type of task 
      - task completion time = access time + motion time
        - Task: Press spacebar -> aquire device -> position cursor on target -> select target
      - Results: Knee Control, Light-Pen, Mouse were the best so far. The Mouse had the best error rate by far.

1981 ~ Xerox Star launched

    - Launched in Chicago at NCC
    - First Computer with a GUI and mouse with point-select
    - Took 10yrs to develop

1982 ~ ACM SIGCHI formed

    -  The ACM Special Interest Group is formed on HCI and is the worlds largest organization of professionals who work in research and practice of computer-himan interaction

1983 ~ Pyschology of HCI pusblished

    - Model Human Processor

1984 ~ Apple Macintosh launched

    - First successful system with a GUI and point-select interaction
    - inpsured by the Xerox Star

2022 ~ 40th anniversary of CHI the SIGCHI conference

    - Two-finger gesture (Apple iPhone, 2007) -> 1978
    - Acceleration-sensing (Nintendo Wiimote, 2005) -> 1998
    - Wheel Mouse (Microsoft Intellimouse, 1996) -> 1993
    - Single-stroke text input (Palm Graffiti, 1995) -> 1993

C:D Control Display Ratio (Mouse Sensitivity)
Computer of the 21st Century ~ Invisible Computer
