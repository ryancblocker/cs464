Also I am the only team member so I am doing everything myself. It's been a ton of work but I can't wait to see the final product. 

The assembly and wiring alone of this project has been so difficult as I am not an electrical engineer and since I didn't have any replacement for any of my equipment I took extra care in making sure I was connecting the right wires and doing a lot of learning outside this project to complete it. Before building this glove I knew nothing about crimping wires or daisy chaining or 3D printing for that matter. It has definitely been a serious learning opportunity for me. 

As far as meetings/working on this project goes I have a busy schedule with my other classes but I have blocked out a few hours every week to work on this aside from class, I tend to work on this on Tuesday and Thursdays from around 1-3pm. 

Hope you have a great day!
